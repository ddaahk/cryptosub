e366mep,92i9yt,"If you are talking about masternode shares.....unfortunately, we currently don't have services (to my knowledge) due to the legalities of holding other ppl's Dash. Both major services closed their MN share services this year due to legalities. I used both - MooCowMoo's MN share service and Splawik's service. Both were great. Both returned my Dash as the services closed down. Hopefully, things will change. Also, further down the road, there are plans for interest bearing Dash accounts based on ""staking"" Dash.",1532752757.0,2,Critical_Input
e36j8gk,92i9yt,"Dash‚Äôs blockchain is still protected by normal proof of work. I believe you are asking how you can stake your coins and that isn‚Äôt possible with dash. We have masternodes but those still assist in the proof of work signing blocks with miners.

I believe you are mixing up POW with POS?",1532777623.0,1,coingun

e36xe2e,92i9yt,"My understanding is that Splawik closed down the MN share aspect of his service because it entails holding others peoples monies (Dash in this case).

Was just trying to find my communications with MooCowMoo over why he stopped the safer service, but could not find them.

e36c1ap,92jyay,"Dex exchanges are the future. It makes a good point about creating decentralised dns servers too. Building on dex and peer2peer and creating better security for users will hopefully mitigate the hack FUD that circulates MSM. Another exchange that will drop in August is u/Localcoinswap. Peer2peer, no kyc with 20 fiat types and 20+ tokens at launch. Should disrupt the status quo!",1532761728.0,0,DZdadathome
e36miyw,92jyiu,"In terms of PrivateSend you mention is this FUD or not? Well we have had an open bounty for breaking PrivateSend for many years and this bounty has never been broken. If this privacy was so poor don't you think someone would have broken this and collected this reward?  


Another thing is PrivateSend requires mixing before you actually get to send the coins. You have to mix your coins then you can use the mixed coins to make the send.   


I was really surprised that you only mentioned the privacy features of Dash and talked nothing about InstantSend (arguably much more revolutionary then PS). Also you completely missed governance? These two alone should have moved Dash up to number 3-4 on your list.  


2,3,4 Exchange tokens? Sorry this is crazy. You literally mentioned buying tether for a good store of value? Well yeah it's supposed to be 1 USD?!?! That is the hole point. I think you are really misleading people with this advice on exchange tokens.",1532783150.0,1,coingun
