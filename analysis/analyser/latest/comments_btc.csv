> The reason the service is so expensive is because you’re effectively destroying small amounts of bitcoin by creating an unspendable transaction to store data. In this case, about $1 worth of bitcoin was used for the transaction and the rest of the $8 presumably goes to the Twitter bot’s creator, Jonathan Otto. Yet as Otto pointed out to me, he won't be making $8 in profit on every tweet since the price of Bitcoin fluctuates so wildly.

> To use the Bitcoin network, you have to pay a fee for every transaction and the higher fee you pay the faster that transaction will get pushed through the network and confirmed. **The fee rate varies wildly depending on how much traffic there is on a network,** which Otto said made finding a price for posting a tweet to the network difficult. Last week, he decided on charging 8 satoshis (one satoshi is one hundreth of a millionth of a bitcoin) per byte of data in a tweet since this was a reasonable rate to push data onto the Bitcoin blockchain quickly. 

> Yet only a few days later, transaction fees to push data onto the blockchain are over ten times that amount. According to Bitcoinfees, to get data on the blockchain quickly it will cost about 110 satoshis per byte today. In January, when the Bitcoin frenzy was at its peak, this was as high as 900 satoshis per byte, Otto told me. This means archiving a tweet (up to 600 bytes) could have cost about 540,000 satoshis in January. The price of Bitcoin hit a high of over $18,000 that month, which means that posting a single tweet to the Bitcoin network could have cost about $100. 

> **""While deliberating on various pricing strategies, I decided to settle on $9 USD and hoped that fees would remain low, but now just a few days into it I'm going to have to make some pricing decisions,"" Otto told me in an email.

I propose a slightly different but I think important alternative view:

Blockstream and friends bet everything on ~~lightning~~ maintaining control of the blockchain and hashing power. Lightning would have been allowed (not attacked), maybe liquid introduced as an alternative, a small block increase to appease the masses, etc. They could have allowed many things to happen from a position of control without needing to worry too much.

Bitcoin Cash has very seriously fucked up that plan and and revealed the emperor’s lack of clothes. A block increase would now show weakness instead of royal beneficence. Lightning now has to actually compete instead of being the solution for the masses by royal decree.

What's misleading is passing BTC off as [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) when it deviates in a material way with almost every section of that white paper, including the title

We understand you guys don't think Bitcoin as described in the paper will work.  That's OK.  If you don't agree with a coin's design, the correct approach is to *mine an altcoin* not [hijack the project](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage).

But you guys *did* end up hijacking the project, starting by throwing out the top devs, then the attack on the rbitcoin community, then the endless failed compromises (8-4-2, the failed HK agreement, the NYA bait-and-switch, need-I-continue). 
 This has all been [quite well documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) for [some time now](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada). 

In doing so you (maybe not you personally, but the people whose side you are taking) split the community irreparably.  rbtc literally would not exist except for [theymos throwing out thousands and thousands of people simple for not supporting Bitcoin Core](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/).  BCH would not exist except for the [years of persistent attacks and failed compromises](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mg4tm/updated_dec_2017_a_collection_of_evidence/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage).

> While it can’t be owned the devs should have control over the ticker since that’s the globally recognized name/face of bitcoin

And who, pray, are ""the devs?""

I'd point out that of the four major compatible BTC full-client implementations (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic) only one of these opposed larger blocks.

If your answer is that Bitcoin Core is the only devs that can define Bitcoin, then you do not have a permissionless coin.  You have an organization called Bitcoin Core with a single individual at the top ultimately responsible for what is and is not ""Bitcoin.""

That's all they are good for, which is also the largest weakness because they are no different from speculating on stocks.

Once the dust settles and adoption spread, only 2-3 coins will exist and there will be no need to convert to fiat, as always intended by Satoshi.

The Gov. will make us pay all the costs and the Blockchain will spit out a report on everyone (probably directly to Google to monetize) and the Gov can automate their responses (demands upon us, if any) to the growing database. Cryptography might allow some privacy, but, they may prohibit that use for financial matters.

Our goal is to make BCH as usable as cash, for everyone, everywhere, even if they earn just $2 per month (as in Venezuela).

Miners earn the transaction fees, and by having thousands of transactions paying tiny fees, they will be able to earn more than by having a few transactions paying huge fees.

We would rather have a lot of people paying a small fee and tons of transactions than a small number of people paying a large fee as on BTC. Ultimately the former will be more remunerative for miners, and was the original Satoshi vision for scaling bitcoin.

BCH devs are committed to low fees going forward, so we should expect to see penny fees for the foreseeable future, to get into the next block.

The entire third world who are more money sensitive will likely be willing to wait slightly longer to obtain free transactions, which will get them into the second or third block.

Try that on BTC and you might wait a week or literally forever for your transaction to clear. I had a BTC transaction with a $5 fee not clear for a week last November because right after I sent it the backlog occurred and people were paying $50 fees to even get into blocks. My poor transaction had to just sit there and wait.

Because BCH is new we're in a rare period where BCH has more capacity than BTC but fewer transactions. That won't last long, and it will likely result in BCH gaining in price on BTC.

If you think the BTC camp is angry at us now, just wait until we pass them in transactions and our price ratio begins improving significantly compared to BTC. They will lose their minds with fear and dread.",1524924114.0,7,Anen-o-me

dy4hpo1,8fi1bn,"Maybe, but the scaling limit is far higher than they want you to believe. BTC has a maximum block size of 4 MB, depending on segwit usage. Currently the maximum possible is as low as 1.2 MB. That was higher than the mean block size when Bitcoin network was clogged, by the end of last year.

But what will happen when Bitcoin Cash have the kind of demand to fill 1 MB blocks? Nothing, because the block size limit is 8 MB, thus, we already have more than 4 times the capacity of Bitcoin, assuming full segwit usage. In May, this number goes to 32 MB, more than 16 times the capacity of BTC.

Then you may ask: will BCH suffer some side effect of having 8 MB of data that BTC avoided by having this effective limit of 1.2 MB? In other words, how big can be a block so that Bitcoin Cash will keep working as it is now? The truth is, we don't really know. I am sure it can handle perfectly well blocks of 100 MB. People of Bitcoin Unlimited have experimented with 1 GB blocks, and at least one guy made his argument that Bitcoin Cash can handle [1 TB block right now](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html)!

The BTC people are trying to achieve by their propaganda campaign what their technology is incapable of delivering.

That is why they attack us and no one else. They whip up their partisans into a frenzy over small things because they fear what our tech can do, even if they won't admit it even to themselves.

Remember that BCH proposes the flippening, which means BCH would replace BTC as the top relevant coin in the crypto space, and nearly pulled it off when B2X was cancelled and there was a mad rush out of BTC and into BCH. 

They have turned crypto into a political sphere because they wanted control and profit. They were willing to cripple bitcoin to obtain both. And they did so.

Except we escaped them and their influence, and that makes us the thorn in their side that they can never get rid of. 

Had crypto been any other commercial software project, they would own the code and could change it anyway they want and the world would be locked out.

But since they can't do that, they are trying to find other ways. First by silencing all opposition and censoring all opposing viewpoints.

Secondly, by demonizing anyone who challenges then publicly.

It's bad behavior. I'm not surprised many here are angry about it. After all, many here have been banned from forums they control, typically for lousy and unfair reasons.

Note how the other forum bans everyone for just talking about other cryptocurrencies, UNLESS you are trash talking other crypto, especially BCH, then you're golden, you get to the front page, etc.

That stance is outright hypocritical, and is designed to condone and build anger and hate against BCH.

But the BTC case makes no sense, because their project is all about not trusting the miners. Evident from the fact that they are willing to even cripple the currency just so every raspberry Pi can check on the miners. Not to mention that mining follows price, which you already exposed as a bad definition. 

Then there's the definition by the whitepaper.

Since 2015, when it became clear that Blockstream is against that and it has control over the community, there's been the proposition to add the change without Core. Gavin and Mike tried to do it in 2016 but were stopped by censorship and DDoS. There were numerous other attempts through the years and in 2017 the Bitcoin ABC developer Amaury Sechet bit the bullet and without waiting for total concensus announced his software will support bigger blocks since August. 

As I said, many people already supported the idea. Miners and developers moved to his software and created the fork of the old BTC blockchain (the same forking happened with SegWit too, but people had no way to choose because it was a soft fork). Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are just some of the supporters of this change. I'd argue the block increase idea was created by Satoshi, when he [explained](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) how it will be done, thus Bitcoin Cash is the project that Satoshi started, not Bitcoin Core.
